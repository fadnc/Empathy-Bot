# üß† ReflectAI ‚Äî AI-Powered Reflective Journaling Companion

## üí¨ Overview

ReflectAI is an intelligent journaling application designed to provide emotional support and help users track their emotional well-being through AI-powered reflection. It combines sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and empathetic AI responses to help users understand their emotional patterns over time.

Built with Python and Streamlit, ReflectAI works both locally and deploys seamlessly to the cloud using Streamlit Cloud's infrastructure.

**This project was developed as part of a Capstone Project under the MSc Computer Science (Data Analytics) program.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Google Gemini API key (free tier available at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys)
- Optional: Ollama installed locally for offline mode

### Quick Start

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fadnc/Empathy-Bot.git
cd Empathy-Bot
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Setup Environment Variables

Copy the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
DB_PATH=journal_entries.db
```

**Getting your free Gemini API key:**
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy it to your `.env` file

#### 5. Run Locally
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at: **http://localhost:8501**

## üåê Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with your repo pushed
- Gemini API key

### Steps

1. **Prepare Repository**
   - Ensure `.env` and `.streamlit/secrets.toml` are in `.gitignore`
   - Push your code to GitHub

2. **Deploy via Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository, branch, and `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Add Secrets**
   - Once deployed, click Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Secrets
   - Paste your secrets:
     ```toml
     GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
     ```
   - Save (app auto-redeploys)

### How It Works
- **Locally:** Tries to use local Ollama first, automatically falls back to Gemini if unavailable
- **Cloud:** Automatically uses Gemini API via encrypted secrets (Ollama not available on cloud)

## üß† How the AI Works

### Reflection Generation
1. Your entry is sent to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API (or local Ollama if available)
2. The AI generates context-aware responses including:
   - **Reflection:** Empathetic 2-3 sentence response tailored to your emotional state
   - **Summary:** One-line emotional theme
   - **Actionable Insight:** Practical suggestion for a small step forward
   - **Follow-up Questions:** 2 supportive prompts for deeper reflection
   - **Coping Suggestion:** Grounding technique if sentiment is low (e.g., 5-4-3-2-1 grounding)
   - **Tone:** Description of response style
   - **Safety Flag:** Indicates if distress was detected

### Emotion Detection
- **Sentiment:** TextBlob calculates polarity (-1 to +1)
- **Emotion Classification:** Zero-shot classification using `facebook/bart-large-mnli` transformer
- **Supported Emotions:** Anxious, overwhelmed, lonely, ashamed, grieving, joyful, content, frustrated, hopeful, peaceful, angry, stressed, unmotivated, confused, neutral
- **Severity Mapping:** Critical, High, Moderate, Good, Excellent

### Pattern Recognition
- **Similarity Matching:** TF-IDF vectorization to find thematically similar past entries
- **Emotion Transitions:** Identifies which emotions frequently follow others
- **Low-Mood Analysis:** Extracts common themes and words from difficult entries
- **Sentiment Trends:** Weekly and monthly sentiment patterns

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not valid" Error on Streamlit Cloud

This occurs when the Gemini API key is invalid, expired, or not properly set in Streamlit Cloud secrets.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify your API key is active:**
   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys
   - Confirm your key exists and hasn't been deleted
   - If deleted, create a new one

2. **Test the key locally first:**
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   python -c "import google.generativeai as genai; genai.configure(api_key='$GEMINI_API_KEY'); print(list(genai.list_models()))"
   ```
   - If this shows available models, your key is valid
   - If it shows an error, the key is invalid

3. **Re-add secrets to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to your app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets
   - Delete the existing key
   - Save
   - Add it again (copy-paste carefully, no extra spaces)
   - Save again (app auto-redeploys)

4. **Common causes:**
   - Free trial API key expired (Google gives 60-day free tier)
   - Copy-paste error (extra spaces or characters)
   - Using a key from a different Google account
   - Key was revoked or disabled

5. **If still failing:**
   - Create a completely new API key
   - Delete the old one
   - Update Streamlit Cloud secrets
   - Redeploy

### Issue: Ollama Not Found Locally

If you see warnings about Ollama, it's fine‚Äîthe app will automatically use Gemini instead. Ollama is optional for local development.

To use Ollama locally:
```bash
ollama serve
# In another terminal:
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
MODEL = "models/gemini-2.5-flash"  # Gemini model version
DB_FILE = "journal_entries.db"     # Database file path
CRISIS_WORDS = [...]               # Crisis detection keywords
COPING_STRATEGIES = {...}          # Emotion-specific coping techniques
```
